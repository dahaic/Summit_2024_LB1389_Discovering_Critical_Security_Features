.*Lab Length*
* Medium/Average (~15 minutes)

.*Goal*
* Learn how to deploy Opportunistic IPsec to encrypt all host-to-host communication
within an enterprise network

.*Objectives*
* Generate X.509 certificates using a Python helper script
* Configure Opportunistic IPsec on two or more nodes
* Debug and monitor the network for IPsec encryption

=== Introduction
Whenever two hosts in the network send any kind of
traffic, IPsec security automatically activates and encrypts all
traffic between those hosts. This is also called mesh encryption.

Imagine a LAN of various machines. Each machine is given an X.509
certificate in the form of a PKCS#12 file (for example, *ipsecXXX.example.com*).
Machines in the network automatically
initiate IPsec encryption and authenticate each other based on these
certificates whenever any traffic is attempted between these nodes. This is
called Opportunistic IPsec.

There are two machines available to you for this lab.
But because this configuration method's main feature is scalability,
you can use another X.509 certificate and repeat the process for any
other provided lab VM. But be careful--if you misconfigure IPsec
and do not allow fallback to cleartext, you can lock yourself out of a VM.

=== Creating and Installing X.509 Certificates

In this section, you generate the required X.509 certificates. To make this
easier, a script (`/root/vpn-cert-gen.py`) provided on *ipsec.example.com* generates x.509 certificates for *ipsec.example.com* and
*ipsec2.example.com* for the lab. If you want to try to add
more machines to the encrypted mesh network, it also creates certificates
for *audit.example.com* and *usbguard.example.com*. All your actions are run as *root*.

. If you are not already there, log in to the workstation bastion host as *{USERNAME}*:
+
[%nowrap]
----
ssh -o "ServerAliveInterval 30" %USERNAME%@%BASTION_IP_ADDRESS%
----

TIP: Use `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste in the terminal.

. Answer `yes` to accept server's identity if asked, and then input the following password:
+
[%nowrap]
----
%BASTION_PASSWORD%
----

. Log in to the *ipsec1.{GUID}.internal* host:
+
[%nowrap]
----
[%USERNAME%@bastion ~]$ ssh ec2-user@ipsec1.%GUID%.internal
----

. Use the sudo command to become root:
+
[%nowrap]
----
[ec2-user@ipsec1 ~]$ sudo su
[root@ipsec1 ec2-user]#
----

. Create the X.509 certificates for the lab:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 ec2-user]# mkdir /root/labcerts

[root@ipsec1 ec2-user]# cd /root/labcerts

[root@ipsec1 /root/labcerts]# /root/vpn-cert-gen.py --wipe
creating CA cert
OK: CA system completely re-initialized

[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# ls
cacerts  certs  keys  mobileconfig  pkcs12  serial.txt

[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# ls pkcs12/
audit.example.com.p12  ipsec2.example.com.p12  ipsec.example.com.p12  servera.example.com.p12  usbguard.example.com.p12
----
+
The `cacerts/` directory contains the CA certificate.
+
The `certs/` directory contains the regular node certificates.
+
The `keys/` directory contains the private keys, but the script has already combined these for you into PKCS#12-based certificates in the `pkcs12/` directory.
+
The `mobileconfig/` directory has Apple device profiles that include the PKCS#12 certificate and all of the other configuration items that are needed for those devices. These files are only useful when building a Remote Access VPN server. You do not use them for
this mesh host-to-host encryption using Opportunistic IPsec.


. Select the proper `pkcs12/*.p12` files for each of the hosts you want to add to the crypto mesh.

=== Configuring Opportunistic IPsec

==== Installing and Initializing `libreswan` and Importing the Certificate

. Install `libreswan` and initialize the certificate database using the following commands to first set up *ipsec.example.com*:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# dnf install libreswan
[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# ipsec initnss
----

. After `libreswan` is installed, import the PKCS#12 certificate:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# ipsec import /root/labcerts/pkcs12/ipsec.example.com.p12
Enter password for PKCS12 file:
pk12util: PKCS12 IMPORT SUCCESSFUL
correcting trust bits for Certificate Agency (CA) - Test Org
----

. When prompted for the import password, type *secret*.

. Confirm that the node's certificate and CA certificate are installed and
available to `libreswan`:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d

Certificate Nickname                                         Trust Attributes
                                                             SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

mycert                                                       u,u,u
Certificate Agency (CA) - Test Org                           CT,,
----

. We will copy the certificate for the ipsec2 machine into /tmp, because the scp command we will
use later does not allow the root user and the ec2-user does not have access to /root/labcerts/
+
----
[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# cp /root/labcerts/pkcs12/ipsec2.example.com.p12 /tmp/
[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# chown ec2-user /tmp/ipsec2.example.com.p12
----

==== Configuring Hosts for IPsec

In this section, you configure the *ipsec1.{GUID}.internal* and *ipsec2.{GUID}.internal* hosts
for IPsec. For these two hosts, the configuration file is already created for
you and placed on the machine at `/root/oe-cert.conf`.

. Copy this file into the `/etc/ipsec.d/` directory so that `libreswan` can use it:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# cp /root/oe-cert.conf /etc/ipsec.d/
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you look at the `oe-cert.conf` file, you can see it defines a number of
connections. These connections are the groups that you can assign
to network IP ranges. A connection specification is defined within a `conn`
section in the configuration file.

* `conn private` means that IPsec is mandatory and all plaintext is to be dropped.
* `conn private-or-clear` means that IPsec is attempted, but it falls back to cleartext if it fails.
*  `conn clear-or-private` means that it does not initiate IPsec, but responds to a
request for IPsec.
* `conn clear` never allows or initiates IPsec.
====

. Edit the `/etc/ipsec.d/oe-cert.conf` and change the default `leftcert=mycert` to `leftcert=ipsec.example.com` 

. If you are running with SElinux enabled, make sure that all of the files are
properly labeled:

+
----
[root@ipsec1 labcerts]# restorecon -Rv /etc/ipsec.*
----

. Add an IP address (for example, `192.168.0.66`) or network range (for example,
`192.168.0.0/24`) into one of these groups, by simply adding one line with the
IP address or network (in CIDR notation) into one of the files matching
the connection name in `/etc/ipsec.d/policies`.

. Configure the machines to attempt Opportunistic IPsec for the entire
`192.168.0.0/24` range by adding that network range to the `private-or-clear`
group:
+
----
[root@ipsec labcerts]# echo "192.168.0.0/24" >> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear
----

. Add a more specific entry into the "clear" group so that workstation
communication always takes place unencrypted and you can always use it to log in to
other machines to reconfigure or debug:
+
----
[root@ipsec labcerts]# echo "192.168.0.54/32" >> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear
----
+
This allows you to log in to all of the machines via the workstation.

. Tell the `firewalld` system service that you want to open the firewall
for the required packets for IPsec:
+
----
[root@ipsec labcerts]# firewall-cmd --add-service=ipsec --permanent

[root@ipsec labcerts]# firewall-cmd --reload
----

=== Transferring the Configuration to a Second System

In this section, you configure the next machine, *ipsec2.{GUID}.internal*. Because the
*ipsec1.{GUID}.internal* host contains all of the certificates, you must copy the
certificate onto *ipsec2.{GUID}.internal* via the bastion host.

. If on the *ipsec1.{GUID}.internal* machine, logout to get back to the bastion host. Otherwise log in to
the workstation bastion host as *{USERNAME}*:
+
[%nowrap]
----
ssh -o "ServerAliveInterval 30" %USERNAME%@%BASTION_IP_ADDRESS%
----

. Then copy the ipsec2 certificate from ipsec1 to ipsec2:

[%nowrap]
----
[%USERNAME%@bastion ~]$ scp ec2-user@ipsec1.%GUID%.internal:/tmp/ipsec2.example.com.p12 /tmp
[%USERNAME%@bastion ~]$ scp /tmp/ipsec2.example.com.p12 ec2-user@ipsec2.%GUID%.internal:/tmp
----

. Install `libreswan`, import the certificate on *ipsec2.example.com*, and configure it for Opportunistic IPsec:

. Log in to the *ipsec2.{GUID}.internal* host as *root*:
+
[%nowrap]
----
[%USERNAME%@bastion ~]$ ssh ec2-user@ipsec2.%GUID%.internal
----
+
----
[ec2-user@ipsec2 ~]$ sudo su
[root@ipsec2 ec2-user]# cd
[root@ipsec2 ~]# dnf install libreswan
[root@ipsec2 ~]# ipsec initnss
[root@ipsec2 ~]# ipsec import /tmp/ipsec2.example.com.p12

(Note: The password for PKCS12 file is "secret".)

[root@ipsec2 ~]# rm /tmp/ipsec2.example.com.p12
[root@ipsec2 ~]# cp /root/oe-cert.conf /etc/ipsec.d/
[root@ipsec2 ~]# restorecon -Rv /etc/ipsec.d
[root@ipsec2 ~]# echo "192.168.0.0/24" >> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear
[root@ipsec2 ~]# echo "192.168.0.54/32" >> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear
[root@ipsec2 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=ipsec --permanent
[root@ipsec2 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
----

. Edit the `/etc/ipsec.d/oe-cert.conf` and change the default `leftcert=mycert` to `leftcert=ipsec2.example.com` 
+
Now you have configured the first two nodes. For each additional node, all you
need to do is generate and install a new certificate, add the same configuration
file with the updated `leftcert=` entry, and update the policy groups in
`/etc/ipsec.d/policies/` to match the first two nodes of the cluster. So for each
added node, you do not need to reconfigure any of the previous nodes, as those
are already configured to trust the same CA and talk IPsec to the same IP ranges
as the new nodes. Because all of the configuration files (other then the PKCS#12 certificate) are
identical on all or the nodes, in a production setting, you should be able to populate new nodes
using Ansible^(R)^.  It is also possible to generate all host certificates with the same friendly_name
"mycert" and then you do not need to edit the `leftcert=` line in the the `oe-cert.conf`

=== Using Opportunistic IPsec

You are now ready to test the configuration.

First, you start the IPsec subsystem on both of the hosts.

. Start the IPsec subsystem on *ipsec1.{GUID}.internal*:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 ~]# systemctl start ipsec
----

. Start the IPsec subsystem on *ipsec2.{GUID}.internal*:
+
----
[root@ipsec2 ~]# systemctl start ipsec
----
+
. Wait a few seconds for the two hosts to load their IPsec policies.

. On *ipsec1.{GUID}.internal*, `ping` *ipsec2.{GUID}.internal* from *ipsec1.{GUID}.internal* to trigger an IPsec tunnel:
+
[%nowrap]
----
[root@ipsec1 ~]# ping -c3 *ipsec2.{GUID}.internal*
----
+
The first `ping` may fail depending on the time it takes to set up the IPsec
connection.

. Examine the system logs in `/var/log/secure`, or you can use one of the
various status commands available:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 ~]# ipsec trafficstatus
006 #2: "private-or-clear#192.168.0.0/24"[1] ...192.168.0.22, type=ESP, add_time=1523268130, inBytes=1848, outBytes=1848, id='C=CA, ST=Ontario, L=Toronto, O=Test Org, OU=Clients, CN=ipsec.example.com, E=pwouters@redhat.com'
----

. Examine the output to see the non-zero byte counters for IPsec packets that shows that the kernel
IPsec subsystem has encrypted and decrypted network packets.
+
[TIP]
====
A more verbose command is:

----
[root@ipsec ~]# ipsec status
<lots of output>
----
====

Your two nodes now have an IPsec-encrypted mesh network running.

=== Troubleshooting (Optional)

. If you think something went wrong and the `ipsec status` command does not show you
the `private`, `private-or-clear`, and `clear-or-private` connections (and their
instances), issue a manual command to see why loading failed:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 ~]# ipsec auto --add private
----

. If there is some kind of failure (such as the group is `private` but the remote end
is not functioning), do not expect to see a visible IPsec tunnel, but
examine the results and expect to see the _shunts_ that prevent or allow unencrypted
traffic on the network:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 ~]# ipsec whack --shuntstatus
000 Bare Shunt list:
000
000 192.168.0.23/32:0 -0-> 192.168.0.22/32:0 => %drop 0    oe-failing
----
+
[NOTE]
====
There are a few kinds of shunts. The `negotiationshunt` determines what
to do with packets while the IPsec connection is being established. Usually
people want to hold the packets to prevent leaks, but if encryption is only
"nice to have" and an uninterrupted service is more important, you can set this
option to `passthrough`. The `failureshunt` option determines what to do when
negotiation fails. For the `private-or-clear` entry in your configuration file,
you can see it is set to `passthrough`, allowing unencrypted traffic. For the
`private` entry you can see it is set to `drop` to disallow unencrypted traffic.
====

. Run `ping` on one host and `tcpdump` on the other host to confirm that the
connection is encrypted:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 ~]# tcpdump -i ens3 -n esp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on ens3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
05:58:18.003410 IP 192.168.0.22 > 192.168.0.23: ESP(spi=0x84019944,seq=0x6), length 120
05:58:18.003684 IP 192.168.0.23 > 192.168.0.22: ESP(spi=0x5b312cc5,seq=0x6), length 120
05:58:19.004840 IP 192.168.0.22 > 192.168.0.23: ESP(spi=0x84019944,seq=0x7), length 120
05:58:19.005096 IP 192.168.0.23 > 192.168.0.22: ESP(spi=0x5b312cc5,seq=0x7), length 120
05:58:20.006529 IP 192.168.0.22 > 192.168.0.23: ESP(spi=0x84019944,seq=0x8), length 120
05:58:20.006730 IP 192.168.0.23 > 192.168.0.22: ESP(spi=0x5b312cc5,seq=0x8), length 120
----
+
If you see ESP packets with `tcpdump`, it means the connection is sending
encrypted traffic. If you use `ping` and see ICMP packets, then the connection is
not encrypted. Due to how the kernel hooks for IPsec and `tcpdump` interact,
if you look at all traffic over an interface, you might see unencrypted packets
going out and encrypted (proto ESP) and decrypted packets coming in. This
happens because packets are encrypted by IPsec after the `tcpdump` hook has seen
the packet on some kernel versions. The easiest indicator of whether traffic is
encrypted is to use the above-mentioned `trafficstatus` command.

. Simply repeat this process on any new node to create your crypto mesh.
+
If you added the entire network range (`192.168.0.0/24`) to the `private` or
`private-or-clear` groups, then for every new node you add, you do not need to
reconfigure anything on the existing node.

. Optionally, redo the test--but this time, do not run `libreswan` on one node--then perform a ping.
+
Expect to see a few packets stalled or failing (based on whether the IP or subnet
appears in `/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private` or
`/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear`) before it fails to clear or installs a
block.

. Additionally, if you run into more problems or you want to see in detail what is
happening, enable two lines in `/etc/ipsec.conf` to get all of the logs in a file
with full debugging:
+
----
# example /etc/ipsec.conf
config setup
 logfile=/var/log/pluto.log
 plutodebug=all

include /etc/ipsec.d/*.conf
----
+
It is important to use file logging with full debugging
because otherwise the `rsyslog` or `systemd ratelimit` may cause you to miss messages.

. If everything works as expected, enable the IPsec
services on your cluster on every startup--on each node run:
+
----
[root@ipsec1 ~]# systemctl enable ipsec
----

For more information on Opportunistic IPsec, see link:https://libreswan.org/wiki/Main_Page[Opportunistic IPsec^].

=== Resetting the IPsec NSS Certificate Database (Optional)

Libreswan uses the NDD cryptographic library. It keeps all of its X.509
certificates and keys in its own NSS database in `/etc/ipsec.d`.

. If you want restart the entire lab from scratch, run the
following commands to remove the entire `libreswan` NSS database:
+
[WARNING]
====
Executing these commands requires you to restart the IPsec lab from
the beginning.
====
+
----
[root@ipsec1 ~]# systemctl stop ipsec
[root@ipsec1 ~]# rm /etc/ipsec.d/*.db
[root@ipsec1 ~]# ipsec initnss
Initializing NSS database
----

. Follow the same procedure for `ipsec2`.

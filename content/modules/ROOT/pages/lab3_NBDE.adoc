.*Lab Length*
* Medium/Average (~15 minutes)

.*Goal*
* Understand how to use Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) to securely decrypt LUKS-encrypted volumes

=== Introduction
Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) allows the user to encrypt root volumes of hard drives on physical and virtual machines without requiring manual entry of a password when systems are restarted.

Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux^(R)^ (RHEL) implements NBDE with a central server named Tang and a client framework named Clevis. Tang is used to bind data to a secure network. It is stateless and does not require TLS or authentication. Tang does not interact with client keys, so it never obtains identifying information from the client. Clevis provides automated unlocking of LUKS volumes.

Tang and Clevis are generic server and client components that provide network bound encryption. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, they are used in conjunction with LUKS to encrypt and decrypt root and non-root storage volumes to accomplish NBDE.

This lab covers setting up NBDE using the command line interface, but Cockpit also provides the same functionality in `cockpit-storaged`. You are able to add, edit, and remove both passphrase-based keys and key server keys.

You install the *Tang* server on the *NBDE1* server and the Clevis client on *NBDE3*.

=== Installing the Tang Server

. Log in to the *NBDE1* server as *ec2-user*, and switch users, using sudo, to *root*. If you need the *root* password, it is *r3dh4t1!*. If you are prompted for the disk decryption password, it is also *r3dh4t1!*.
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
[{USERNAME}@bastion 0 ~]$ ssh nbde1.{GUID}.internal
[{USERNAME}@nbde1 ~]$ sudo su -
----
+

. Install the `tang` packages:
+
----
[root@nbde1 ~]# dnf install tang
----
+

. Enable the `tang` service in `systemd` and open the HTTP port in the firewall:
+
----
[root@nbde1 ~]# systemctl enable tangd.socket --now
[root@nbde1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=http
[root@nbde1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
----
+
Because `tangd` uses the `systemd` socket activation mechanism, the server starts as soon as it receives the first connection. A new set of cryptographic keys is automatically generated upon initial startup.

. Log out of the *NBDE1* server.
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
[root@nbde1 ~]# exit
[{USERNAME}@nbde1 ~]$ exit
----

=== Installing the Clevis Client
Your *NBDE3* client is already encrypted. In this section, you install the client packages that allow you to decrypt the root device drive upon boot without manual intervention.

. Log in to the *NBDE3* server as *ec2-user*, and switch users, using sudo, to *root*. If you need the *root* password, it is *r3dh4t1!*. If you are prompted for the disk decryption password, it is also *r3dh4t1!*.
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
[{USERNAME}@bastion 0 ~]$ ssh nbde3.{GUID}.internal
[{USERNAME}@nbde3 ~]$ sudo su -
----

If you get an error like the following when trying to ssh into `nbde3.{GUID}.internal` follow the steps below and resume the lab steps.

[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
[{USERNAME}@bastion ~]$ ssh nbde3.{GUID}.internal
{USERNAME}@nbde3.{GUID}.internal: Permission denied (publickey).
----

Log in to the *NBDE3* server as *root*  and enter the LUKS password *r3dh4t1!*.

[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
[{USERNAME}bastion ~]$ ssh root@nbde3.{GUID}.internal
Please enter passphrase for disk luks-7e6104e8-e282-4a7e-955f-cde7c7283765! ********
Connection to nbde3.{GUID}.internal closed.
----

. Install the Clevis packages:
+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# dnf install clevis clevis-luks clevis-dracut
----

. Initialize the LUKS binding to the *Tang* server, using *r3dh4t1!* as the LUKS password.

+
[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# clevis luks bind -d /dev/xvda2 tang '{"url":"http://nbde1.{GUID}.internal"}'
The advertisement contains the following signing keys:

1234abcdef5678GHIJK90lmnopq

Do you wish to trust these keys? [ynYN] y
Enter existing LUKS password:
----
+
This command performs four steps:

* Creates a new key with the same entropy as the LUKS master key
* Encrypts the new key with Clevis
* Stores the Clevis JWE object in the LUKS header with LUKSMeta
* Enables the new key for use with LUKS

. Answer `y` when asked to trust the keys.

. Enter *r3dh4t1!*, which is the existing LUKS password.

This disk can now be unlocked with your existing passphrase, as well as with the Clevis policy.

=== Verifying the LUKS Header

. Use the `cryptsetup luksDump` command on *NBDE3* to verify that the Clevis JWE object is successfully placed in a LUKS header:
+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# cryptsetup luksDump /dev/xvda2

. Examine the header and expect to see that there are two key slots in the header.
+
The `0` key slot represents the static password you entered when booting the machine for the first time and key slot `1` is the newly added entry by the `clevis luks bind` command.

=== Enabling Decryption on the Boot Process

. Enter the following command on *NBDE3* to enable the early boot system to process the disk binding:
+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# dracut -f
----
+
[TIP]
====
Pass the *-vf* parameter if you want to see verbose output.
====

=== Rebooting NBDE3 and Testing the NBDE Configuration

. Reboot *NBDE3*:
+
----
[root@nbde3 ~]# reboot
----

. On machines with console access you would be able to see the prompt for the LUKS passphrase and then see that the server would automatically begin the boot process without requiring you to enter a password.
 However, in the lab environment we will have to wait for *NBDE3* to come back up.
+
This may take up to five minutes in the lab environment.

. You may watch to see when *NBDE3* comes back online, by using *ping*:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
[{USERNAME}@bastion 0 ~]$ ping nbde3.{GUID}.internal
PING nbde3.{GUID}.internal (192.168.0.242) 56(84) bytes of data.
----

=== Initializing the LUKS Binding to the Tang Server using Cockpit
Your *NBDE2* server is already encrypted. In this section, you install the client packages that allow you to decrypt the root device drive upon boot without manual intervention.

The `cockpit-storaged` package is already installed for you, and Cockpit is already enabled as well.

==== Initializing the LUKS Binding

In this section, you initialize the LUKS binding to the *Tang* server using Cockpit.

==== Connecting to the GUI through a VNC Client

[TIP]
====
It is not necessary to re-install a VNC client, if you already completed these steps, in lab 1.
====

.. First you open an SSH connection using port forwarding. This will open a connection forwarding the port `5901` to your localhost (you don't need to run this if it has been done in OpenSCAP exercise):
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -N -f -L 5901:localhost:5901 {USERNAME}@{OPENSCAP_IP_ADDRESS}
----

.. Answer `yes` to accept server's identity if asked, and then input the following password. Note that this will create a background SSH process, so you can use the same terminal to run the next step:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
{OPENSCAP_PASSWORD}
----

.. Open TigerVNC (it's called either tigervnc or vncviewer) application and type under `VNC Server` text input:
+
[%nowrap]
----
localhost:1
----

.. Click `Connect` and then answer `yes` to accept server's identity if asked and input the following password in the pop up window:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
{OPENSCAP_PASSWORD}
----

. Open a Firefox web browser:
+

. Click *Encrypted data* for */dev/xvda2*:
+
image:nbde_cockpit_disk_page.png[window=_blank,link=nbde_cockpit_disk_page.png]

. Click the *Encryption* tab for the disk:
+
image:nbde_cockpit_disk_page_1.png[window=_blank,link=nbde_cockpit_disk_page_1.png]
+
. Expect to see the current keys for the disk, and note that at present there is only one passphrase key:
+
image:nbde_cockpit_disk_enc.png[window=_blank,link=nbde_cockpit_disk_enc.png]

. Click the *+* button to add one more key, and expect the modal window to look like this:
+
image:nbde_cockpit_tang_empty.png[window=_blank,link=nbde_cockpit_tang_empty.png]

. Complete the modal window fields as shown, using *nbde1.{GUID}.internal* as a key server address and *r3dh4t1!* for the existing disk passphrase, then click *Add*:
+
image:nbde_cockpit_tang_filled.png[window=_blank,link=nbde_cockpit_tang_filled.png]

. After giving the system some time to process the request, click *Trust key*:
+
image:nbde_cockpit_tang_confirm.png[window=_blank,link=nbde_cockpit_tang_confirm.png]

. Examine the results, and note both the disk passphrase and the key server as your keys for the disk:
+
image:nbde_cockpit_keys_result.png[window=_blank,link=nbde_cockpit_keys_result.png]
+
Expect your key to be different from the key shown in the image.

This disk can now be unlocked with your existing passphrase as well as with the Clevis policy.

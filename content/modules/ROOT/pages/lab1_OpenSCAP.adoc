.*Lab Length*
* Medium/Average (~10-20 minutes)

.*Goal*
* Become familiar with the basics of automated security and compliance scanning and remediations with OpenSCAP and Red Hat^(R)^ Ansible^(R)^ Automation

=== Introduction
Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a collection of standards to enable automated vulnerability and configuration compliance.
OpenSCAP is a family of open source SCAP tools, and the SCAP Security Guide (SSG) is a collection of XML-based SCAP benchmarks and content in various formats to help with compliance configuration assessment of Red Hat Enterprise Linux^(R)^ (RHEL) machines.
Natively shipping in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenSCAP provides practical security hardening advice and remediations for Red Hat technologies and helps with meeting security compliance requirements, making it easier to obtain security certifications and accreditations.

OpenSCAP and SSG allows you to perform both vulnerability and security compliance checks in a fully automated way.

OpenSCAP is integrated into Red Hat Satellite for automated security and compliance scanning across multiple Red Hat systems at scale. OpenSCAP, Red Hat Satellite, and Red Hat Ansible Automation can also all be integrated together for automated and continuous scanning and remediations for security and compliance across a hybrid environment at scale.

In this lab, you focus on single host scanning and remediations for security vulnerabilities and compliance to security baselines using the security tools built info Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

==== Setup Steps (Preconfigured)
All of the steps in this setup section are already completed for you.
This section is for reference only so that you know what is already configured in this lab environment.

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 is installed on the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* host.
+
[NOTE]
====
Versions of installed packages may not be up-to-date, but this does not affect the lab.
====

* Additionally, *openscap-scanner*, *scap-security-guide*, *ansible-core* and *rhc-worker-playbook* are installed on the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* host.
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
[{USERNAME}@bastion ~]# ssh openscap.{GUID}.internal
[{USERNAME}@openscap ~]$ sudo su
# the tool that performs the scanning
[root@openscap]# dnf install openscap-scanner
# project that brings in security policies we will load and test agains
[root@openscap]# dnf install scap-security-guide
# allows execution of ansible playbooks
[root@openscap]# dnf install ansible-core rhc-worker-playbook
----

* To verify a successful installation, run:
+
----
[root@openscap ~]# oscap -V

OpenSCAP command line tool (oscap) 1.3.8
Copyright 2009--2021 Red Hat Inc., Durham, North Carolina.

==== Supported specifications ====
SCAP Version: 1.3
XCCDF Version: 1.2
OVAL Version: 5.11.1
CPE Version: 2.3
CVSS Version: 2.0
CVE Version: 2.0
Asset Identification Version: 1.1

...
----
+
Note that this command outputs the OpenSCAP version and versions of supported standards.
If during your own installation a message indicates that the `oscap` command is not found, this means OpenSCAP is not successfully installed, and you must install the OpenSCAP tooling (as detailed earlier).

* SCAP Workbench is also installed on the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* server host for you:
+
----
# GUI tool for scanning and benchmark customization, a front-end for OpenSCAP
[root@openscap ~]# dnf install scap-workbench
----

=== Accessing the Graphical User Interface of your dedicated OpenSCAP environment

. This is a Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux^(R)^ 9 system with GUI. It is the machine that you will use throughout all of the exercises in this lab. To access the Graphical User Interface (GUI) you need a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) client.

==== Connecting to the GUI through a VNC Client
If Tiger VNC is already installed (`vncviewer` in the command line), jump to next section. Otherwise, follow the below steps to install it.

. We recommend you to install `tigervnc`, check how to install here: link:https://tigervnc.org/[window=_blank,Tiger VNC]. Or run one of the following:

.. RHEL:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
dnf install tigervnc
----

.. Fedora:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
dnf install tigervnc
----

.. Ubuntu:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
apt-get install tigervnc-viewer
----

.. macOS:
... link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/tigervnc/files/stable/1.11.0/TigerVNC-1.11.0.dmg/download[window=_blank,TigerVNC-1.10.1.dmg^]

ifndef::gitlab_hosted[]
. After you install `tigervnc`, if you are on a Linux system, run the following commands on a terminal from your system:
endif::[]

ifdef::gitlab_hosted[]
. After you install `tigervnc`, if you are on a Linux system, run the following commands on a terminal:
endif::[]

.. First, open an SSH connection using port forwarding. This will open a connection forwarding the port `5901` to your localhost:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -N -L 5901:localhost:5901 {USERNAME}@{OPENSCAP_IP_ADDRESS}
----

.. Answer `yes` to accept server's identity if asked, and then input the following password. Note that the terminal hangs because of the port forwarding. In the end of the workshop you can terminate the connection by hitting `Ctrl+C`:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
{OPENSCAP_PASSWORD}
----

. To set up an SSH connection using port forwarding from Windows, first, download and install link:https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[window=_blank,puTTY].
.. Launch puTTY
.. Go to `SSH` → `Tunnels`
.. Source port `5901`
.. Destination `127.0.0.1:5901`
.. Make sure `Local` is checked because it’s a local tunnel.
.. Click `Add`

+
image:puttytunnel.png[window=_blank,link=puttytunnel.png,700,700]

.. Go to `Session`
.. Fill in {OPENSCAP_IP_ADDRESS} in the `Host Name (or IP address)` field.
.. Click `Open`

+
image:puttymain.png[window=_blank,link=puttymain.png,700,700]

.. If a window prompts about accepting an unknown SSH key, click `yes`.

+
image:puttysecuritywarning.png[window=_blank,link=puttysecuritywarning.png,500,500]

.. Login as {USERNAME} with password:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
{OPENSCAP_PASSWORD}
----

+
image:puttyterminal.png[window=_blank,link=puttyterminal.png,900,900]

. Now open TigerVNC (it's called either tigervnc or vncviewer) and in the `VNC Server` field input:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
localhost:1
----

.. Click `Connect` and then answer `yes` to accept server's identity if asked and input the following password in the pop-up window:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
{OPENSCAP_PASSWORD}
----

If an alert appears stating that the connection isn't secure, disregard that alert. Although VNC data is unencrypted by default, you're accessing the VNC server using an encrypted SSH tunnel.

Congratulations, you are in your *graphical console* using a VNC connection.

// ==== Connecting to the GUI through a RDP Client

// . As second option, it is possible to connect to the GUI using a RDP client and we recommend to use `rdesktop` software. To install `rdesktop` run one of the following:

// .. Fedora:
// +
// [%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
// ----
// dnf install rdesktop
// ----

// .. Ubuntu:
// +
// [%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
// ----
// apt-get install rdesktop
// ----

// ifndef::gitlab_hosted[]
// . After you install `rdesktop`, you can run the following command on a terminal from your own machine:
// endif::[]
// ifdef::gitlab_hosted[]
// . After you install `rdesktop`, you can run the following command on a terminal:
// endif::[]
// +
// OpenSCAP:
// +
// [%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
// ----
// rdesktop {OPENSCAP_IP_ADDRESS} -u {USERNAME} -p {OPENSCAP_PASSWORD}
// ----

// . On Windows, you can follow the instructions here: link:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028379/windows-10-how-to-use-remote-desktop[How to Use Remote Desktop on Windows]. Use the following credentials when asked:
// +
// OpenSCAP:
// +
// [%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
// ----
// IP Address {OPENSCAP_IP_ADDRESS}
// Username: {USERNAME}
// Password: {OPENSCAP_PASSWORD}
// ----

// Congratulations, you are in your *graphical console* using an RDP connection.

=== Using Automated Security and Compliance Scanning with OpenSCAP

. If not already there, log in to the workstation bastion host as *{USERNAME}*:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -o "ServerAliveInterval 30" {USERNAME}@{BASTION_IP_ADDRESS}
----

TIP: Use `Ctrl+Shift+V` to paste in the terminal.

. Answer `yes` to accept server's identity if asked, and then input the following password:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
{BASTION_PASSWORD}
----

. Log in to the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* host:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
[{USERNAME}@bastion ~]# ssh openscap.{GUID}.internal
----

. Now, switch to *root* with the following command:
+
[%nowrap,source,ini,subs=attributes+]
----
[{USERNAME}@openscap ~]$ sudo su
----

. Examine the compliance content provided by `scap-security-guide`:
+
----
[root@openscap ~]# rpm -ql scap-security-guide
...
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel9-ds.xml
----
+
Note that content provided in `scap-security-guide` covers a wide range of security baselines.
For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9, profiles like Spanish National Cryptologic Center (CCN) and  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) profiles are available.
There are various formats in which this is provided--human-readable HTML guides, SCAP benchmarks, and Ansible remediation playbooks.

. Move to the `content` folder so that you can avoid typing long paths in the subsequent exercises:
+
----
[root@openscap ~]# cd /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content
----

. Determine which content and compliance profiles are available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9:
+
----
[root@openscap content]# oscap info ssg-rhel9-ds.xml
----

. Perform your first security compliance baseline scan with the CCN profile:
+
The scanning command must be executed by a privileged user: `root` or using `sudo`. Therefore the scanner can access system parts that are off-limits to common users.
The simplest scanner invocation can look like this:
+
----
oscap xccdf eval --profile ccn_basic ./ssg-rhel9-ds.xml
----
+
You can omit the profile ID prefix to make the command simpler--the actual ID is `xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ccn_basic`.
+
You also want to store the scan results, so you can process them later.
Therefore, you need to supply additional arguments.

. Store the results of the scan this time:
+
----
[root@openscap content]# oscap xccdf eval --oval-results --profile ccn_basic --results-arf /tmp/arf.xml --report /tmp/report.html ./ssg-rhel9-ds.xml
----
+
--
* `--results-arf` gets the machine-readable results archive.
* `--report` gets a human-readable report, which can also be generated from ARF after the scan (as shown in the optional step that follows).
* `--oval-results` provides additional details of failing rules.
--

. (Optional) Generate the HTML report separately:
+
----
[root@openscap content]# rm -f /tmp/report.html
[root@openscap content]# oscap xccdf generate report /tmp/arf.xml > /tmp/report.html
----

. Access the GUI interface and open the file `/tmp/report.html` in firefox. Expect to see the security compliance scan results for every security control in the CCN security baseline profile in HTML format:
+
image:lab1.1-scapreport.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.1-scapreport.png,500,500]
+
[NOTE]
====
Rules can have several types of results, but the most common are *pass* and *fail*, which indicate whether a particular security control has passed or failed the scan.
Other results you can encounter frequently are *notapplicable*, for rules that were skipped as not relevant to the scanned system, and *notchecked*, for rules without an automated check.
====

. Click any of the rule titles in the HTML report, such as the rule highlighted in red in this image:
+
image:lab1.1-clickrule.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.1-clickrule.png,600,600]

. Wait for the dialog to appear, then scroll down to examine the details of the OpenSCAP security rule that failed or passed--in this case, it shows which file failed the regex check:
+
image:lab1.1-report_fail.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.1-report_fail.png,HTML report: A rule that is failing]
+
If the `--oval-results` option is specified on the command line when scanning, extended details are provided.
For example, if an OpenSCAP security rule is testing file permissions on a list of files, it specifies which files failed and their permission bits.

. Browse through the report to see all of the different checks performed.
+
The machine is in a state equivalent to a default installation.

. When you are finished, close the Firefox window.

=== Customizing SCAP Security Profiles Using SCAP Workbench

==== Using SCAP Workbench

. In the GUI, click `Activities` in the top left corner of the screen, then `Show Applications` button, and finally select the green circle icon for SCAP Workbench.
+
image:lab1.2-workbench_launch.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.2-workbench_launch.png,600,600]

. Select *RHEL9* and click *Load Content* to open the compliance content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9:
+
image:lab1.2-scapsecurityguide.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.2-scapsecurityguide.png,600,600]
+
image:lab1.2-workbench_opened.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.2-workbench_opened.png,SCAP Workbench opened, profile selected]

==== Customizing PCI-DSS Control Baseline and Tests

. For *Profile*, select the *PCI-DSS* entry, then click *Customize* next to the profile:
+
image:lab1.2-selectcustomize.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.2-selectcustomize.png,700,700]

. In the *Customize Profile* window, leave the default *New Profile ID* name and click *OK*:
+
image:lab1.2-newprofileID.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.2-newprofileID.png,500,500]
+
Now you can select and unselect rules according to your organization's needs and change values such as minimum password length to tailor the compliance profile.
+
The toolbar at the top of the window provides options to help you create and customize the profile. Notice the *Deselect All* and *Search* buttons, which can be very useful when creating a new profile from scratch.

TIP: To ensure this scan completes in a timely manner, make sure that "Verify File Hashes with RPM" is unchecked.

[start=3]
. Customize the profile as you like, then click *OK* to save it:
+
image:lab1.2-workbench_tailoring.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.2-workbench_tailoring.png,SCAP Workbench content customization]

. Click *Scan* to run a test scan with the new custom profile you just created, typing *{OPENSCAP_PASSWORD}* when prompted for the *GTPE Student* password, then inspect the results:
+
image:lab1.2-scapworkbenchscan.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.2-scapworkbenchscan.png,500,500]
+
This take a few minutes to complete.
+
[NOTE]
You may proceed with the remainder of this lab before the scan completes. You can ignore and close the diagnostics window that appears at the end of the scan.

. (Optional) Select *File->Save Customization Only* to save the customization to a tailoring file:
+
image:lab1.2-savecustomization.png[window=_blank,link=lab1.2-savecustomization.png,300,300]

=== Automated Security Remediations with OpenSCAP and Ansible
Putting the machine into compliance--for example, by changing its configuration--is called *remediation* in SCAP terminology.
Because remediation changes the configuration of the machine to restrict its capabilities, it is possible for you to lock yourself out or disable workloads important to you.
As a result, it is a best practice to test the remediation and its effects before deploying.

==== Testing Remediation
All remediations are executed on the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* host.

. Automatically generate an Ansible Playbook
using the `--fix-type ansible` option to request a playbook with the scan result fixes:
+
----
[root@openscap]# oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type ansible --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > playbook.yml
----
+
This puts the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* machine into compliance based on a given security compliance profile from the previous scan results of the CCN security baseline profile.

. (Optional) Generate the bash remediation script using `--fix-type bash` to request a bash script with the fixes:
+
----
[root@openscap]# oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type bash --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > bash-fix.sh
----
+
By running either the automatically generated Ansible remediation playbook or the bash remediation script, the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* machine is put into compliance to the CCN security baseline profile.
+
TIP: Note that in both cases you use an empty `--result-id`. This is a trick to avoid specifying the full result ID.

==== Setting Ansible Remediation Options

In this section, you focus on the Ansible remediation options.

. Open the generated playbook using a text editor (nano is used here, but vi can also be used):
+
----
[root@openscap]# nano playbook.yml
---
###############################################################################
#
# Ansible remediation role for the results of evaluation of profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ccn_basic
# XCCDF Version:  1.2
#
...
#
# How to apply this remediation role:
# $ ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local playbook.yml
# $ ansible-playbook -i "192.168.1.155," playbook.yml
# $ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
#
###############################################################################
----

. Examine the generated playbook in detail and note the various Ansible tasks for configuring this machine to make it compliant with the CCN security baseline profile:
+
----
    - name: Ensure PAM variable minlen is set accordingly
      lineinfile:
        create: yes
        dest: "/etc/security/pwquality.conf"
        regexp: '^#?\s*minlen'
        line: "minlen = {{ var_password_pam_minlen }}"
      tags:
        - accounts_password_pam_minlen
        - medium_severity
        - restrict_strategy
        - low_complexity
        - low_disruption
        - CCE-80656-2
        - NIST-800-53-IA-5(1)(a)
        - PCI-DSS-Req-8.2.3
        - CJIS-5.6.2.1.1
----

. Customize the playbook by changing the variables listed at the top of the generated file--in this case, change the password minimum length by setting the `var_password_pam_minlen` to `!!str 18`:
+
----
...
    var_password_pam_minclass: !!str 4
    var_password_pam_minlen: !!str 18
    var_password_pam_retry: !!str 3
    var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs: !!str 45
    var_accounts_minimum_age_login_defs: !!str 2
...
----
+
[TIP]
====
After making this change, press *Ctrl+X*, then type *y* and press *Enter* in your nano text editor to save your changes.
====

. Run the playbook locally on the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* host in check mode to see how it would change the machine to put it into compliance with the CCN security baseline profile. For demonstration purposes we are going to check only one rule:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Not all modules utilized by compliance ansible playbooks are part of *ansible-core* package. To allow compliance hardening, these modules are provided in *rhc-worker-playbook* package, supported in the context of *scap-security-guide*-sourced ansible playbooks.

Using it on the commandline requires providing environment variable *ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH*.
====
+
----
[root@openscap]# ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=/usr/share/rhc-worker-playbook/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/ ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local --tags accounts_password_pam_minlen --check playbook.yml

IMPORTANT: If you omit the `--check` and `--tags` parameters from the previous command, the resulting machine is compliant with the provided rules in the CCN security baseline profile. If you apply the remediation you won't be able to connect through SSH using *root* to the *openscap.{GUID}.internal* machine. This is because the machine is hardened with the Ansible remediation playbook for the CCN security baseline profile and one of the requirements of the CCN security baseline profile prohibits to connect through SSH using login as *root*.
